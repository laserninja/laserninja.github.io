My mom always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. 

\- Forrest Gump

In my Undergrad, I designed a healthcare product to address the lack of medical facilities in rural areas and used data generated to do a preliminary diagnosis without a doctor. I and my friend started a web consultancy where we digital transformed business and used their data to improve their business. After my undergrad, I was an associate SAP consultant in India, where I analyzed data for some fortune 500 companies.

This made me realize the potential of data to transform business and lives of people. Which lead me here at CMU perusing my Master in Information Systems Management. Having lived in Australia, Malaysia, India and United States of America, I am passionate to solve global problems, explore and implement the new emerging technologies, to solve social and business problems.

PS. Just a thought, I think we will solve "Intelligence" in our lifetime.
